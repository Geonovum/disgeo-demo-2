# Data
Many different data sources are used in the demonstrator. Some of these are already available production data or had already been produced for experiments, others have been published as linked data on the occasion of this demonstrator.

Selection criteria for the data:
- The premise is that ALL data that we use in the demonstrator is Linked Data. In some cases, we still convert data ourselves.
- Primary preference for production data.
- The data must be available for at least one of our two use case areas: Rotterdam or Castricum.

The collection and preparation of the data was largely already done in the weeks prior to High 5. At 2:45 PM on Day 1 of High 5, all data required for the demonstrator is reasonably complete. This was faster than in previous similar experiments.

Datasets where it is indicated that they are available via Kadaster Labs can be found on the [Kadaster Labs DISGeo landing page] (https://data.labs.kadaster.nl/disgeo/), also available via the [SPARQL endpoint] ( https://api.labs.kadaster.nl/datasets/disgeo/disgeo/services/disgeo/sparql). The landing page describes which data is available per dataset and under which license it may be used.

We used BAG data via https://bag. basisregistraties.overheid.nl/sparql.

We also used:
- GWSW data from RIONED: https://sparql.gwsw.nl/ https://sparql.gwsw.nl/sparql

- Primary school data (DUO): https://lod.onderwijsregistratie.nl/
- 3D data Rotterdam
- Area data (BOR) of the Province of Noord-Holland of the routes N203 and N513 (Uitgeest, Castricum) [SPARQL endpoint] (https://data.labs.kadaster.nl/disgeo/AreaaldataN203N513/sparql/AreaaldataN203N513)
